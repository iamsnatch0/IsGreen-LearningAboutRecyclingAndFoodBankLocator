        <h1>Importance Of  Recycling</h1>
        <h3>It’s important that we all recycle properly, by putting the right things in the right bin. This means that recyclable materials aren't contaminated by things people have put in the wrong bin.
         No matter which borough you live in you can put the following items in your recycling bin: cartons, mixed glass bottles and jars, food tins and drinks cans, mixed paper and card, mixed plastic packaging.</h3>

              <h5> Glass </h5>
              <b style="font-size:17px;">Glass can be recycled over and over without any loss in purity or quality. For every ton of glass that is recycled, 
                over one ton of natural resources are saved. Using recycled glass cuts energy costs and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. </b>

              <h5> Plastic  </h5>
              <b style="font-size:17px;">Used plastics are versatile and adaptable, as illustrated by their wide range of uses. 
                There is a large market for recycled plastic bottles and containers, and keeping that valuable material out
                of landfills also helps reduce energy use and emissions.</b>

                <h5> Paper </h5>
                <b style="font-size:17px;"> Every ton of paper recycled saves 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space. Approximately 75% of U.S. paper mills use some recovered 
                  fiber to make everything from paper-based packaging and tissue to office paper and newspaper.</b>

                   More than 4.4 million tons of electronic equipment in the U.S. are recycled each year, which helps prevent valuable material 
                   from going into the waste stream.</b>

              <b style="font-size:22px;">Recycling is a significant element in the protection of natural resources and contributes significantly to environmental improvement.

                  <h2>Paint/Oil</h2>
                  <b style="font-size:26px;">It is important that you recycle your engine oil correctly as even a small amount of oil can cause damage to the environment as well as making a noticable mess. 
                    The Oil Care Campaign has been set up by the Environment Agency, in association with SEPA in Scotland and Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) in Northern Ireland,
                    to try and reduce pollution from oil and to help people dispose of their engine oil safely and correctly. On the Oilcare site there is a oil bank locator where you can type 
                    in your postcode and find the nearest place to take your used engine oil to for safe disposal.
                    Remember: UK oil banks are for waste engine oil, not cooking oil, thinners, white spirit, paint or any other chemical.</b>
                    <ol style="font-size:26px;">
                      <li> Waste such as paint, paintbrushes, car oil and oil filters 
                        have to be carefully disposed of, as they can be very damaging to the environment.</li>
                        <li>Don’t pour oil or paint down the drain.</li>
                        <li>Donate unwanted paints and varnishes, as others can reuse them.</li>
                        <li>Look for disposal or recycling instructions on the packaging of the product.</li>
                        <li>Civic amenity sites often take engine oil for recycling.</li>
                        <li>Buy products in bulk whenever possible to reduce packaging waste.</li>
                        <li>Use eco-friendly alternatives whenever possible.</li>

              </div>
              <div class="center-col">
                  <h2>Batteries</h2>
                  <b style="font-size:26px;">Batteries can be found in every room in the house. They are used in electrical and electronic items, for example: toys, remote controls, mobile phones, alarm clocks and even doorbells.
                     In fact, every person in Britain uses about 10 batteries a year! Thousands of tonnes of CO2 emissions could be avoided if the UK meets its recycling targets. In the UK, around 40,000 tonnes of portable batteries were sold in 2018, 
                     with only around 18,000 tonnes being recycled. Most batteries are put into rubbish bins and then taken to landfill sites. 
                    There are different types of batteries which can contain dangerous chemicals including: lead,cadmium, zinc, lithium and even mercury.
                    When batteries begin to rot away in landfill sites these chemicals may leak into the ground, which can cause soil and water pollution. When chemicals contaminate soil and water animals, 
                    humans and the environment can be harmed. Recycling is a great way to help protect the environment. Each battery placed in a recycling bin will be taken 
                    apart and the materials will be used to make something new.
                  </b>
                  <ol style="font-size:26px;">
                    <li>All waste batteries are classified as hazardous waste and recycling is always the best option.</li>
                    <li>Ordinary household batteries do contain some hazardous chemicals so ideally should not be thrown out with the day to day rubbish.</li>
                    <li>Rechargeable batteries contain harmful metals, so should never be thrown away with daily rubbish, they should be returned to manufacturer for disposal or recycled elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>Local councils or garages sometimes offer battery-recycling services.</li>
                    <li>Contact your local council to see if they are running a battery collection scheme.</li>
                    <li>Contact the battery manufacturer for further recycling advice.</li>
                    <li>Ordinary batteries require a lot of energy to make, so in order to save energy, use rechargeable batteries and electricity mains instead of ordinary batteries.</li>
                    <li>Rechargable batteries are the most environmentally friendly option as can last for up to several hundred charging cycles resulting in less waste being produced.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <b style="font-size:26px;">Some councils collect batteries as part of their household collection service but in most areas you will need to take them to a
                    recycling centre or a collection point in a supermarket, a DIY centre or even your local shop.</b>

                  <h2>Yard Debris</h2>
                  <b style="font-size:26px;">Yard debris currently make up over 13% of waste sent to landfills. Composting turns yard trimmings into nourishment 
                    for the soil and can be used as mulch. 
                    That keeps materials out of landfills where they take up space and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
                    Yard debris can be composted right at home. Add them to a compost pile outdoors along with food scraps. Some communities collect larger brush or have collection 
                    points and then turn these yard trimmings into mulch that is offered to residents. Grass clippings that are left onsite will decompose and return nutrients to the soil. Leaves can be used as mulch around trees and shrubs to retain moisture. Yard trimmings can be added to your outdoor compost pile.
                    Recovered wood can be used for mulch, fuel, compost, animal bedding, and even in manufactured products such as particle board.

                    <h2>Textiles</h2>
                    <b style="font-size:26px;">
                      Clothes and textiles that are in good condition can be donated and sold for re-use. This is an important way to minimise the overall impact that clothing has on our environment. Items that aren’t suitable to be passed onto someone else can be recycled and made into new items,
                      such as padding for chairs and car seats, cleaning cloths and industrial blankets.
                    </b>
                    <ol style="font-size:26px;">
                      <li>Check to see if your council collects clothes and textiles to be recycled.</li>
                      <li>Drop off your unwanted items at recycling points and clothing and textile banks in supermarket and local car parks – enter your postcode below to find your nearest. </li>
                      <li>Donate items to registered charities and re-use organisations. 
                      The Charity Retail website will help you to find your nearest charity shop. </li>
                     <li> One of the most convenient ways to donate clothes is through registered charity collection services. Some charities, such as The British Heart Foundation, offer a free clothing collection service from your home. 
                      It's easy to arrange via their website. You don't even need to order a bag, just re-use your own bags and boxes from home.</li>
                      <li>If you are fundraising for your school, church or organisations such as Girl Guides or Scouts, there are textile companies who can arrange a collection to help you to raise money for your cause. </li> 
                     <li>Many high street retailers such as Primark and M&S now offer clothing donation banks in-store. These are sometimes called 'bring back schemes'. 
                      This means that next time you pop out to the shops, you can drop off a bag of your old clothes. Simple!</li>
