# IsGreen-LearningAboutRecyclingAndFoodBankLocator
IsGreen is a website that I created for my final year project in university to reduce food wastage in the United Kingdom.  
The purpose of this project is to help people to understand how they can share food and reduce the waste created in their homes. 
The project also provides a solution for the issue of wastage, by explaining the approach taken to tackle the problem and explaining 
how a platform can be created to help the people with the issue at hand. The website is user friendly and easy to navigate, it requires registration 
and login to be able to access it. Also, it uses the userâ€™s Ip address to locate the nearest food bank, so they are able to donate.
